abstractions to make extremely customizable/stateful components extremely maintainable and extendable

- suspense
  - handle loading states out of the component
  - make sure to run them in parallel
- global query cache
  - revalidate on every mutation
- context distributed store
  - testable and reusable
- slots
  - basically dependency injection
- expose actions through refs
  - may be imperative, but semantically more correct way to expose readonly actions without having to have underlying knowledge of implementation
- initialState over state
  - key to trigger update
- consistency
  - naming
  - interfaces
- error handling
  - consistent error format
  - easy to use error component, if it's not easy it will be easy to avoid error cases
    - pit of success
