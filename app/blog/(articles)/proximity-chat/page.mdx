I've always loved using proxmity audio chat in games I've played, so I thought it would be fun to go through and implement it
on the web.

To implement proximity chat with audio there are 2 main things we need:

- Some place where users can move around/ change their proximity to another users
- A Peer to Peer connection so users can talk to eachother with low latency
