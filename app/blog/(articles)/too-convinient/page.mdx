# too convinient

That's too convenient is a phrase I like to tell myself a lot. I find myself applying the phrase the most when I'm working on X for a while, some new information is added to the system, and a way to interpret the new information is that it works **with X**, or even that it makes X **better**. That must be too convenient, right?

For example, imagine you were the company who made the blackberry before the iphone came out. You put physical keyboards on the devices because that was the only reasonable solution for decades. The iphone comes out, and drops the keyboard. You have 2 possible reactions:

todo: not complete analogy

- people love the click of the keyboard, that wont work
- maybe this makes sense

Surely it's too convenient that the skill issue constrained solution (physical keyboards) happens to also be the best solution.

Sometimes you get lucky and things are that convenient, but frequently new information lets you think of a better solution, but it almost requires you to have no priors.
