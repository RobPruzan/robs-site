## a tool to build tools

A core feature in zenbu I feel strongly about is you should be able to extend the platform using LLMs. If you want a tool that would be super useful for your niche use case, you should be able to ask the app to change itself.

In zenbu’s context, this means you can build devtools to help you “vibe code” better. That may be custom network panel for your framework, or a draw tool that lets you markup the screen which gets fed back to the model.

This idea was working well enough that I wanted this everywhere in my workflow (editor, note taker).

I started experimenting with zenbu as a vscode extension, since I would have the opportunity to use vscode API’s in the model generations. It ended up being a trivial port, and I was able to share all the code because of vscode webviews

The more I played around with this idea, the more I realized the editor is a much better environment for an “app generation” tool to exist. There is no “graduation” penalty you have to pay when you need to export the code from the platform.

The biggest benefit though from colocating the “app generation” with the editor is that you can create tools for the editor, in the editor. All apps that run in a vscode webview can send and recv messages from the vscode api. Meaning these app generations are essentially extensions made on the fly.

This is super powerful, since you can create comprehensive tooling for small projects for near 0 cost/time. This was enough to convince me to pivot the project to being primarily a vscode extension.
