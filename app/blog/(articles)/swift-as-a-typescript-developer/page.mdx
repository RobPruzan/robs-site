Ive had the pleasure to recenly work on iOS development, coming from a strong web development background. I think this is probably a
pretty common progression for most people, as web development is quite a bit easier to get into than iOS development- a single index.html
vs xcode, simulators, project config, story boards, swiftui, uikit, and so on.

The way I go about learning programming languages when optimizing for productivity is mapping concepts/syntax from the current language im learning
to existing languages I already know. The goal of this article will be to relate swift concepts to typescript, and point out core differences.

Im going to start with the most basic language features for people who have not yet used swift, but if you already know some swift feel free to skip ahead to #TBD

## Immutability

This will be a very easy thing to relate as typescript and swift have very similar behavior with respect to defining mutable vs immutable variables. In typescript, to define a mutable variable
you will normally reach for the `let` keyword (omitting var), where let allows you to re-assign data to the variable:

```typescript
let x = 1;
x += 1;
// x = 2
```

And protect the variable from being re-assigned, you would instead use the ``const` keyword

```typescript
const x = 1;
x += 1; // Cannot assign to 'x' because it is a constant.
```

But this is simply an immutable reference, if an object reference is assigned to the variable you can still dereference and mutate it:

```typescript
const x = { y: 1 };
x.y += 1;
// x.y = 2
```

The equivelent in swift is var and let respectively:

```swift
var x = 1
x += 1
// x = 2
```

```swift
let x = 2
x += 1 // error: left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'x' is a 'let' constant
```

And swift has the same semantics, the reference is immutable but the underlying object may still be able to be mutated

```swift
class Foo {
  var x = 0
}

let foo = Foo()
foo.x += 2
// foo.x = 1
```

## The Type System

In TypeScript when we define a type alias:

```typescript
type Foo = { x: 2 };
```

we don't actually care about the name of the type. That's because it's simply an alias. Foo represents the same type as:

```typescript
type Bar = {};
```

All we are about is the actual structure it represents. TypeScript was desinged this
way (as a structual typesystem) to make it maximally compatible with existing JavaScript, but it also ends up being very pleasant to work with.

The first roadblock you will encounter when learning swift is the lack of this ability. The most similar language feature that is very commonly used in swift is a `protocol`.

Swift protocols look very similar to typescript types at first. You give it a name, and some collection of proerties and methods that must exist for **something** to be assignable to the protocol.

```swift
protocol Foo {
  var int
}


```
