# null, but also not null

As a followup to <Link href="/blog/a-different-way-to-think-about-typescript">a different way to think about typescript</Link>, I wanted to share a typescript trick
I've been enjoying (a little too much?) lately.

<SuspenseEditor filePath="./app/blog/(articles)/null-but-not-null/snippets/1.tsx" />

> Note, ! is the <Link href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#non-null-assertion-operator">non null assertion operator</Link>

Which can be read as: the value null, asserted as not being null. Which sounds like nonsense; why wouldn't this produce an error?

Well, here's something even weirder, this compiles even under strict tsc checks

<SuspenseEditor filePath="./app/blog/(articles)/null-but-not-null/snippets/2.tsx" />

but actually, this works for any type...

<SuspenseEditor filePath="./app/blog/(articles)/null-but-not-null/snippets/3.tsx" />

My first reaction when seeing this was it made no sense, and was an escape hatch built into the compiler. But, after thinking about
it for a little longer using the mental model described <Link href="/blog/a-different-way-to-think-about-typescript">in the article</Link>, it makes sense.

If we were to infer a type from `null!`, what would it be? Another way to ask that is: what type constructs a set that contains the value `null!`.

Well, no value exists that is both null, and not null. So if nothing exists in this set, let's just say it constructs an empty set.

If types are modeled as the sets they construct, which sets contain the empty set? More formally, for which sets does the condition hold that
every item in the empty set is in the set we're checking against.

Well, that's every set, right? If the empty set has nothing, then every set has _at least_ nothing.

That should give a good intuition for why `null!` is assignable to every type in typescript

## Practical use case

Now this is a dangerous assertion, as the following code blows compiles... and blows up at runtime:

<SuspenseEditor filePath="./app/blog/(articles)/null-but-not-null/snippets/4.tsx" />

there are 3 cases I find this to be useful:

- placeholder for a future value
- debugging (which kinda falls under the previous point)
  - `complexArgs(null!) // now I can immediately see the properties on the returned value`
- a hacky way to early return when encountering an <Link href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/32727/what-are-invariants-how-can-they-be-used-and-have-you-ever-used-it-in-your-pro">invariant</Link> error, instead of throwing an error

To explain the latter, the following pattern is common:

<SuspenseEditor filePath="./app/blog/(articles)/null-but-not-null/snippets/5.tsx" />

Depending on how your code is written, this can crash the whole program. Which might be the exact behavior you want,
but in some cases, it's useful to allow the program to continue executing for **debugging purposes**.

One solution would be to early return, instead of throwing an error:

<SuspenseEditor filePath="./app/blog/(articles)/null-but-not-null/snippets/6.tsx" />

Though, our function would now return `T | undefined`, where T is the prior return value type.

If, instead, we return null!

<SuspenseEditor filePath="./app/blog/(articles)/null-but-not-null/snippets/7.tsx" />

Our function appears to return `T`, even though there's a branch we early return the value `null`

I still prefer throwing errors in development for invariants, but I like having the optionality to be able to quickly
swap throw new Error(...) with return null! without messing with types.
